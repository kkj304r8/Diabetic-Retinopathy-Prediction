# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Prediction
Data Science Project

Diabetic retinopathy is a serious eye condition caused by high blood sugar levels. It can cause blindness if left untreated.

The objective of this project is to develop a binary classification model that predicts whether a patient is at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy based on various factors. This model can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning, reducing the risk of disease progression.
